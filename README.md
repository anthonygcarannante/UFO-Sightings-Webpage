# Javascript-Challenge

This repository is to showcase my javascript skills by creating an interactive webpage that automatically updates a table displaying UFO sightings.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, D3, Javascript

On the main HTML page, the user is prompted to search a date on the webpage to see if a UFO was spotted on that date. The code uses Javascript to search and filter through a data file to display sightings on the specified date. The JS code prints the following on the webpage: the Date, the City, the State, the Country, the Shape of the UFO, the Duration it was seen, and Comments by the viewer. The JS code uses various functions for button clicking, filtering data, and printing HTML code on the fly to display it in a user-friendly manner.
